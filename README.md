# Focus

[In Development]

Take screenshots on Windows and OS X and upload to imgur.

Inspired by [Pussh](https://github.com/teak/Pussh) as an update to my previous Windows-only [Pixel](https://github.com/vevix/Pixel) application.

Built with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

#### Usage

`Command / Control + Shift + 3` will take a screenshot of your entire screen

`Command / Control + Shift + 4` will allow you to take a crop-based or specific window screenshot

#### Development

First install the node modules required:

```
npm install --legacy-bundling
```

Run the application:

```
gulp serve
```
